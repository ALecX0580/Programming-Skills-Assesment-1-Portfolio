# Assign string to each variable using sentence "Coding is Cool"
word1 = "Coding "   # First word of phrase
word2 = "is "       # Second word of phrase
word3 = "Cool"      # Third word of phrase

# Use string concatenation to combine the variables and print the phrase
# Concatenate word1, word2, and word3 to output "Coding is Cool"
